It is also possible to hide specific columns and customize the width of all the [columns](https://help.syncfusion.com/maui/datagrid/columns?utm_source=github&utm_medium=listing&utm_campaign=maui-datagrid-github-samples) or individual columns with built-in [column sizing](https://help.syncfusion.com/maui/datagrid/column-sizing?utm_source=github&utm_medium=listing&utm_campaign=maui-datagrid-github-samples) options.

### Grouping

Programmatically group data by one or more [columns](https://help.syncfusion.com/maui/datagrid/columns?utm_source=github&utm_medium=listing&utm_campaign=maui-datagrid-github-samples) using flexible templates. The groups can be expanded or collapsed based on user preference. 

### Sorting

[Sort](https://help.syncfusion.com/maui/datagrid/sorting?utm_source=github&utm_medium=listing&utm_campaign=maui-datagrid-github-samples) one or more columns in ascending or descending order. Perform tri-state sorting and display sort numbers to indicate the sort order.
